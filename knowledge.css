SVG
/* if an .svg picture does load in on your device but not on someone elses,
than that's probably because you do not have the right link to it, 
say you made it on dev, and you than bring it to your live environment,
than it still links to dev, that's why that is happening, all you have to do
is change the source from dev to live and it should work! */

@media
/* if you use media, this sounds stupid, but I always forgot this, when you use
a minimum distance, use the hole number of pixels and when you use the maximal
distance you should always do .98px */
