# CSS
This directory holds a default.css that is easy to use on each page that you make.
It is a combination of the most generic bootstrap classes and the things I found to be usefull along the way.

Besides this, there is also a checklist of weird things I've seen and tackled with the code in there.

P.S. If you are a not a fan of the indenting in the default.css file, I am sorry.
Normally I do like it the normal way, but for this file I make an exception because it is easier to read this way.
